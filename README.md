1. What Is Kernel?
A kernel is a central component of an operating system. It acts as an interface
between the user applications and the hardware. The sole aim of the kernel is to
manage the communication between the software (user level applications) and the
hardware (CPU, disk memory etc). The main tasks of the kernel are :
 Process management
 Device management
 Memory management
 Interrupt handling
 I/O communication
 File system...etc..
