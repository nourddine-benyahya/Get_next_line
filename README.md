# What Is Kernel?

A kernel is a central component of an operating system. It acts as an interface
between the user applications and the hardware. The sole aim of the kernel is to
manage the communication between the software (user level applications) and the
hardware (CPU, disk memory etc). The main tasks of the kernel are :

- **Process Management:** Handling and managing processes.
- **Device Management:** Managing communication with hardware devices.
- **Memory Management:** Allocating and managing system memory.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Managing interrupts for timely responses.
- **I/O Communication:** Handling input and output communication.
- **File System:** Managing file organization and storage.
